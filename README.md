# Overview
As a software engineer, I created this project to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and strengthen my ability to write clean, structured, and maintainable code. The goal of this software was to practice core JavaScript concepts while using modern language features and external libraries commonly found in real-world applications.

This software is a Node.js application that processes numerical data and displays results directly in the terminal. It demonstrates the use of ES6 native array functions, recursion, exception handling, and third-party libraries. The program outputs clear, formatted results and includes error handling to ensure the application runs safely and predictably.

The purpose of writing this software was to improve my proficiency in JavaScript syntax, learn how functional programming concepts work in practice, and gain experience using npm packages within a JavaScript project. This project also helped me become more comfortable structuring a complete software project and publishing it to GitHub.

# Development Environment

This software was developed using Visual Studio Code as the primary code editor and Node.js as the runtime environment. Version control was handled using Git, and the completed project was published to GitHub as a public repository.

The programming language used in this project is JavaScript (ES6). External libraries were installed using npm, including Lodash for advanced array utilities and Chalk for styling and coloring console output. These libraries helped simplify data manipulation and improve the readability of terminal output.
# Useful Websites
The following websites were helpful while developing this project:

- [Node.js v25.5.0 documentation]  (https://nodejs.org/en/docs)
- [JavaScript Guide] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)


# Future Work

In the future, I would like to improve and expand this software by:

- Adding user input through the command line instead of using hard-coded data
- Enhancing error handling and validation for additional edge cases
- Expanding the program to process data from files or external sources
